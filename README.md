# Image-Weather-Classifier

## Overview
The project illustrates the process of creating a multi-class image classification model to identify different weather conditions. This includes setting up the environment, downloading and exploring the dataset, defining and configuring a convolutional neural network (CNN) using pre-trained models, training the model, and evaluating its performance through metrics like accuracy and loss over epochs. The process demonstrates how to leverage libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow for building and refining such models, including techniques for data augmentation and using callbacks for improved training.

## Data Details
Data is obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset. The data is used for developing and evaluating a multi-class classification model designed to detect the weather condition shown in an image. There are 11 classes in the dataset. These classes represent different weather conditions. The specific weather conditions represented by the classes are: 'dew', 'foogsmog', 'frost', 'glaze', 'hail', 'lightning', 'rain', 'rainbow', 'rime', 'sandstorm', and 'snow'.

## Code
You can find the project code in the Model.ipynb file, and the API code in the main.py file.
